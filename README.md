# POKER GAME
## DESCRIPTION
 This project is aimed at improving my proficiency level with python programming language. It is created in order to utilize all the numerous lessons learnt while walking through the process involved in software development from identifying business needs/problem to translating it to actionable task.

 ## Technologies
 This project is a Test Driven Development (TDD) written using:
 * Python 3.10

## Functionality Scope
Currently, the project follows most of the rules of a poker game by implementing the logics behind Card Decks, Hand, as well as determining the winner of the game

## Future Work
I will be improving this code to capture more intricate rules and cater for some edge case bugs that might come up.

## Source
This app is based of the Learn to Code with Python tutorial of Boris Paskhaver @BorisPaskhaver
